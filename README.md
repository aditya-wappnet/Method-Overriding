# Method-Overriding

#Brief details of the project

Method Overriding is used to override the parent function.
I have developed a project where the Team leader is asking about Workload then the Senior developer says it's easy but the junior developer says it's hard, here junior developer is in child class so Whatever the junior developer says it will be passed to the team leader as we use the concept of Method Overriding.
The same function is made in both the class parent class and child class workload() and passed the different results to it. As we used the concept of Method Overriding we got the result of child class.
